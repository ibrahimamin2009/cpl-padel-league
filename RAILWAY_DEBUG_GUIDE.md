# Railway Deployment Debug Guide

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Ultra-minimal app works locally
- ‚ùå Railway deployment crashes within seconds
- üîç Need to identify the root cause

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Railway Logs
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on your project
- Go to "Deployments" tab
- Click on the latest deployment
- Check the logs for error messages

### 2. Common Railway Issues
- **Missing dependencies**: Check if all packages in requirements.txt are available
- **Port issues**: Railway sets PORT environment variable
- **Database connection**: PostgreSQL might not be ready
- **Import errors**: Some modules might not be available

### 3. Test Ultra-Minimal App
The current deployment uses `app_test.py` which is:
- Only Flask import
- No database
- No complex dependencies
- Simple routes only

### 4. If Ultra-Minimal Works
If the ultra-minimal app works on Railway, then the issue is with:
- Database imports
- SQLAlchemy configuration
- Email configuration
- Template rendering

### 5. Next Steps
1. Check Railway logs for specific error
2. If minimal app works, gradually add features back
3. If minimal app crashes, check Railway environment

## Current Files
- `app_test.py` - Ultra-minimal test app
- `requirements.txt` - Minimal requirements (Flask + Gunicorn)
- `Procfile` - Points to `app_test:app`

## Expected Behavior
- Railway should deploy successfully
- App should respond to HTTP requests
- No database or complex features
